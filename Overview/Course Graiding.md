## Grading
The cumulative mark for the work during the modulus is based on the mark for the home tasks and on the activity during the seminars 

`Final Grade` = 0.25 $\times$ `Quizes` + 0.75 $\times$ `Project`

`Quizes` = $\dfrac{Test_1 + ... + Test_N}{N}$, where $N$ - is the number of tests.

`Project` =  $\dfrac{CP_1+CP_2}{20}$ +$\dfrac{Research\_Proposal}{10}$ +$\dfrac{Preprocessing\_and\_Data\_Loading}{10}$ + $\dfrac{2 \times EDA}{10}$ + $\dfrac{3 \times Research\_Hypothises\_Validation}{10}$+ $\dfrac{Interpretation\_of\_Results}{10}$ + $\dfrac{Project\_Presentation}{10}$ 

Final exam can be replaced with course project. The grade for the course project must be set **before** the final exam.
