* Sumbission date and time is taken from the date of delivery of the mail message to the professor's @hse.ru address (can be found at the [official page](https://www.hse.ru/en/staff/iakarpov)). Late submission policy: -5% score per day. All submission deadlines are 23:59 GMT+3.

* For the final project, students need to collect data and suggest a way to predict and/or model based on real network data. The assessment for the final project is set on a 10-point scale. Criteria for evaluating the final project.
