## The SIR model [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology)

The **SIR model** is one of the simplest compartmental models, and many models are derivatives of this basic form. The model consists of three compartments:

- **S**: The number of **s**usceptible individuals. When a susceptible and an infectious individual come into "infectious contact", the susceptible individual contracts the disease and transitions to the infectious compartment.
- **I**: The number of **i**nfectious individuals. These are individuals who have been infected and are capable of infecting susceptible individuals.
- **R** for the number of **r**emoved (and immune) or deceased individuals. These are individuals who have been infected and have either recovered from the disease and entered the removed compartment, or died. It is assumed that the number of deaths is negligible with respect to the total population. This compartment may also be called "**r**ecovered" or "**r**esistant".
