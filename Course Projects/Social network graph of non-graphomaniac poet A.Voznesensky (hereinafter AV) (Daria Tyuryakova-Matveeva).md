# Description (CP)
## 1. Title: 
Social network graph of non-graphomaniac poet A.Voznesensky (hereinafter AV). 

## 2. Key idea of project 

The goal of the project: Social Network analysis of AV contacts structure and identification of the most influential people. Why it is worth doing: this will help to understand which professional and social groups AV interacted with and will help identify implicit connections between his contacts, determine the circle of individuals to whom he dedicated his works and whom he mentioned in them. Who did something similar before:

https://sysblok.ru/philology/500-geroev-v-odnoj-sheme-o-chem-govorit-setevoj-analiz-vojny-imira/ 
How we are going to reach the goal? To achieve the goal, I will construct a graph for all the contacts mentioned in the biography and autobiography of AV, and I will create a ranking of the significance of these individuals in the literary community for the list of poets and writers in his circle. 
## 3. Dataset required to do the project

To implement the project, it is necessary to create Ð° dataset, with a planned number of contacts ranging from 300 to 500 individuals, specifying the type of relationship (acquaintance, friendship, romance, correspondence, meeting) and indicating social affiliation (poet, writer, politician, musician, etc.). The challenge in forming this dataset is associated with the possible lack of information about the acquaintance of contacts AB with each other. 

## 4. Anticipated SNA Methods 
I am currently studying the different methods (I don't know for sure yet), planning to try various layouts of social network visualisation.
